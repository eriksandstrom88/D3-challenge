# D3-challenge

This repository contains the required portion of Homework 16 for the University of Denver's Data Analytics Bootcamp.

For the assignment, I used JavaScript to create a scatter plot to visualize median income with obesity rates by state.  I read the data out of a csv, and plotted it by creating a custom visual using D3.js.  Starter code for the index.html file was provided, as was the csv containing the data.

After creating the visual, it is clear that there is a loose negative correlation between income and obesity rates.  That is, generally speaking, the states with the highest median income tend to have lower rates of obesity.
